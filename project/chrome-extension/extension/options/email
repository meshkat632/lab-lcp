Dear All
I could not get any events for the below mentioned users from learning context.
Please do understand that our project is dependent on data from you (group 1 and group2). So post at least few events with already mentioned users so that I can continue my work. Mail me once you have posted the rate page event and comment events to learning context project so that I know when to start testing again.

Also username/password - lcuser11/lcuser11 does not work. So I have created a new username/password - lcuser17/lcuser17. Please use lcuser17 instead of lcuser11 while creating data.

Thank you and best regards
Ravi  Kumar Singh
